## About anxiousness in a math PhD

Self-consciousness is not easy to aquire. It's a long road you have to ride untill you get a gasp of who you really are, and what you can get done. Not knowning their limits is an attractive feature of young people, and, to some extent, be motivated by some project implies that it is still kind of fuzzy in our heads. But knowing nothing, or almost nothing, makes us insecure, fragil, easily excited and easily dissapointed. Part of the PhD's job is getting to know themself, in order to leave this naive state where they began their journey.
El pana cree que $$\lambda$$ es $$7$$.
