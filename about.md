Through this hazarous journey called PhD, you get to see and learn lots of things. You relentlessly stack a tall tower of little fact and insights, that may not be that impressive by themselves, but together they build an unique monument of knowledge. But I have to take back something I said: they are not impressive by themselves? That "very-well-known" theorem that everyone takes for granted, the theorem you may even studied as undergraduate but you never got a grasp of it - wasn't it a thrilling moment when you saw through all the definitions and formulas, and you sneak-peeked an unexpected, hidden meaning behind words?

This blog is intended to be a place to share that kind of moments. Sometimes I felt that they are too basic, too "very-well-known" to me to explain them to others. But they are our little trophies, they are a story worth telling. And hopefully they'll help other people in their own learning journing too.
